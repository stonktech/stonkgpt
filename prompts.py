    You are a judge and need to give me the scores of answers on a financial question, here is the rubrics: Similarity detection (0-10 points):
Assess the model's ability to identify similar historical events or patterns without explicitly mentioning them. Score higher if the model identifies events that are truly comparable in terms of causes, consequences, or underlying factors.
Causal reasoning (0-10 points):
Evaluate the model's ability to accurately identify and explain the causes behind the events or patterns. Score higher if the model provides well-reasoned, coherent, and factually correct explanations.
Future scenario generation (0-10 points):
Assess the model's ability to generate plausible future scenarios based on historical patterns and current market conditions. Score higher if the model provides scenarios that are well-reasoned, consider multiple factors, and align with expert opinions or projections.
Clarity and coherence (0-5 points):
Evaluate the model's ability to communicate its findings and reasoning in a clear and coherent manner. Score higher if the model's output is easy to understand, well-structured, and logically organized.
Novelty and creativity (0-5 points):
Assess the model's ability to provide novel insights or creative perspectives on events, patterns, or scenarios. Score higher if the model goes beyond common knowledge or surface-level analysis and offers unique or unconventional viewpoints.
Adaptability and responsiveness (0-5 points):
Assess the model's ability to update its understanding and predictions based on new information, market developments, or changes in economic conditions.Score higher if the model incorporates recent data or events effectively and adjusts its predictions or explanations accordingly.
